# Building and Improving Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Image Classification

This repository is about building a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented in Keras to classify the MNIST dataset. The code also includes an example of how to load a saved model and use it to make predictions on new data.


## The implementation involves the following steps:

* Importing the required libraries, including Keras.
* Loading and preprocessing the data, including splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, normalizing the pixel values, and converting the class labels to binary class matrices.
* Creating the model, which consists of a sequence of layers, including two convolutional layers, a max-pooling layer, a flatten layer, a fully connected layer, and an output layer.
* Compiling the model, which involves specifying the loss function, optimizer, and metrics to use during training.
* Training the model on the training dataset, using the fit method.
* Evaluating the model on the testing dataset, using the evaluate method.
* Saving the model to a file, using the save method.
* Loading the saved model and making a prediction on a sample image, using the load_model function and the predict method.


## Model Architecture
The model architecture consists of two convolutional layers with ReLU activation functions, followed by a max pooling layer, a flatten layer, and two fully connected layers with ReLU and softmax activation functions, respectively. The model was trained for 12 epochs using the Adadelta optimizer and achieved an accuracy of 88.16% on the test set.

## Improving the Model
Additionally, the code includes an example of how to improve the model's predictive accuracy by changing some of the parameters, such as the number of neurons in the fully connected layer, the optimizer, and the number of epochs. 
If you would like to improve the model's accuracy, you can try changing the architecture or the hyperparameters. One possible change is to add more convolutional layers, increase the number of filters, or use a different activation function. You can also try changing the optimizer, learning rate, or batch size.
